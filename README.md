## What is SCM and how does GitHub help with it?
Source code management (SCM) is used to track and manage changes to source code. GitHub helps with SCM by allowing collaboration with shared projects, and tracking and managing changes made to code over time. It allows people working together on a project to make changes to the code at the same time by creating a separate branch from the main files. Individuals can edit the files independently and then merge the changes back to the main files without interfering with the changes others have made. To see the most recent changes from your team members, you Pull them and to show your changes you Push them.
